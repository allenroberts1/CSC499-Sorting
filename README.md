# CSC499-Sorting

**Requirements:**


**How To run sort:**
To run the source code run it through the command line. Once in command line run the program with this line **java CSC499Part1 "(Input File Directory)" "(Name or directory for output file)" "(a or d)"**. Your inputs should be the file directory to the input file and directory or name for the outputted file, the input directory should look similar to this C:\\\Users\\\\(name)\\\Desktop\\\CSC499\\\namelist.txt and output  directory should look similar to C:\\\Users\\\\(name)\\\Desktop\\\CSC499\\\\(name of output file) or if you just enter a name for the file it will place it in the same directory as the java file. Enter a or d for sorted ascending or descending if nothing is entered or an invalid input is entered ascending is assumed (only the first character is read).

**How To run test:**
Download and run the test.bat file, if any errors occur see troubleshooting

**Troubleshooting:**
If any errors occur while running the test batch file, it could be because the path to java is not set on your computer, to fix that enter this into command line **set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\ (Your version of Java) \bin** which will set the path. If it prints "Couldn't find CSC499Part1" then make sure the batch file is in the same directory as the java file.
